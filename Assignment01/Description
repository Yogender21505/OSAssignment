Part1:(fork() and execl family execvp()/execv()
	wait())
	all Three internal commands handeled
	
	cd , echo and pwd

	all five external commands handeled
	
	ls, cat, date, rm , mkdir

Exception handeled with all wrong inputs


Part2:(pthread_create() and system())
	all three internal commands handeled 

	cd , echo and pwd

	all five external commands handeled
	
	&t ls,&t cat,&t date,&t rm ,&t mkdir many more.

Exception handeled with all wrong inputs

Test cases are:
Part1:
	ls,ls -i,ls -d
	mkdir -v new , mkdir -p new
	cd new
	rm -i filename , rm -r filename
	echo "hello"
	pwd
	cat -s filename, cat -n filename
	date -I, date -R
	
Part2:
	with &t all below commands are handeled
	&t ls, &t ls -i,&t ls -d
	&t mkdir -v new ,&t mkdir -p new
	&t rm -i filename, &t rm -r filename
	&t cat -s filename, &t cat -n filename
	&t date -I, &t date -R
without &t it will works !


rest assumptions will be given by me.
